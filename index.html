        <p>Hi there! My name is Aren Ashlock, and I am a Senior at Iowa State University studying Computer Science.<br>Welcome to my website where you'll hopefully learn more about me, my experience, and see some of the projects I've worked on during college.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My biggest hobby is the <strong>Pokemon Trading Card Game</strong>. I've been playing it since 2013! Through playing the card game, I've gained a lot of social skills, problem-solving skills, and time management (since I often traveled during class on Fridays). It's also allowed me to explore lots of new places, learn about other cultures, and make a lot of friends! During those years, I've achieved some great things such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>World Championships - 4x qualifier</li>
            <li>North American International Championships - Top 16</li>
            <li>Regional Championship - Finalist</li>
            <li>Regional Championship - Top 4</li>
            <li>Regional Championship - 2x Top 8</li>
            <li>State Championship - Champion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of my main goals during college was to <strong>get more involved in clubs/organizations</strong> since I focused mostly on Pokemon during high school. Since coming to college, I've been involved a lot, particularly in clubs outside the STEM field so that I could meet people with other interests. Some of my involvement includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Student Union Board</strong> <a href="https://sub.iastate.edu/">(Link)</a></li>
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                    <li>2023: Vice President of Administration</li>
                    <li>2022: Cyclone Cinema Director</li>
                    <li>2021-Present: General Member</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>2021-22: Martin Hall President</strong></li>
        </ul>
